# Solana Vanity Address Generator CLI 

A high-performance, multi-threaded Solana vanity address generator CLI written in Rust. Generate custom Solana wallet addresses with specific prefixes or suffixes using flexible matching options.

A vanity public key is a Solana address that begins or ends with specific characters you choose. The more characters you want at the beginning of your vanity address, the longer it will take to generate one.

## Features

- ‚ö° Optimized Multi-threaded Performance - Built with [Rayon](https://docs.rs/rayon/latest/rayon/) for efficient parallel processing. Utilize multiple CPU cores for maximum performance.
- üéØ Flexible Matching - Match patterns with lookalike characters (e.g., s matches S, 5).
- üî§ Case Sensitivity - Choose between case-sensitive, case-insensitive. 
- üîç Multiple Match Types - Search for prefix, suffix, or either.
- ‚úÖ Base58 Validation - Automatically validates patterns against Solana's [Base58](https://digitalbazaar.github.io/base58-spec/) character set.
